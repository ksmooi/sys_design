# Using Docker with Cloud Services: AWS, GCP, and Azure

Docker has transformed how modern applications are developed, packaged, and deployed. By containerizing applications and their dependencies, Docker ensures that applications run consistently across multiple environments. When combined with cloud services like AWS, GCP, and Azure, Docker delivers an exceptional blend of portability, scalability, and efficiency. This article outlines how Docker integrates with these cloud platforms, highlighting their key services, use cases, and providing a comparative overview.

## Benefits of Using Docker with Cloud Platforms
